# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Grade-Prediction

In this mini project, the focus is on predicting the final grades of 107 enrolled students in a fully online nine-week machine learning course hosted on Moodle. The dataset includes anonymized information about student grades from mini projects, quizzes, peer reviews, and the final overall grade, along with course logs categorized into different statuses. 

The project unfolds through crucial steps, starting with data processing to handle missing values and decide on feature retention. Subsequently, the dataset is split into training and test sets. Two distinct supervised learning models are then trained to predict final grades, and their performances are rigorously evaluated and compared. The report delves into visualizing model performance and identifies the three most significant features influencing final grade predictions. 

The mini project serves as a practical application of supervised learning techniques to assess and predict student performance, contributing valuable insights into the factors influencing final grades in an online machine learning course.
